    "content": "Nintendo has confirmed that Mario Strikers: Battle League will be receiving new updates after launch. As part of this, fans can look forward to additional characters. Specifics havent been shared just yet though, but we know that the updates will be entirely free. Providing updates after release is a familiar move for Nintendo, especially when it comes to sports games on Switch. With Mario Tennis Aces for example, the game added Koopa Troopa, Blooper, Diddy Kong, Birdo, Shy Guy, Petey Piranha, Luma, Boom Boom, Pauline, Kamek, Dry Bones, Fire Piranha Plant, and Dry Bowser after launch. Meanwhile, we saw Toadette, Ninji, Koopa Troopa, Wiggler, and Shy Guy in Mario Golf: Super Rush after release. Fans have been pretty vocal about the roster in Mario Strikers: Battle League, including their desire to see characters such as Daisy. With the updates coming after the game’s debut, these wishes will be fulfilled.",

    "author": "PlayStation",
    "content": "Hello, Heckstars! It’s Sergey from tinyBuild here, and today I’m incredibly excited to tell you more about our upcoming fast-paced, physics-based, couch multiplayer brawler SpiderHeck. So, how can I describe SpiderHeck to you? In all honesty, it’s so epic, it’s unexplainable. You need to play it for yourself to get where I’m coming from. Because if you put seven-legged spiders (does it make them spiders in this case?), particle blades, laser blasters, rocket launchers, lots of enemies and your friends together, and top that with the physic-based environments and battle mechanics, mind blowing web slinging parkour moves and close calls – that sounds like a crazy hectic game. But its the chaos that makes SpiderHeck so much fun! As the saying goes – a picture is worth a thousand words, so check out the new gameplay trailer below.",

These are places that want to transport players to completely different worlds, new experiences unlike anything you’ve ever had before. Behind the Frame: The Finest Scenery, which releases for the PlayStation 4 on June 2, has its sights set on a different fantasy – one in which you can sink into the delightful routines of everyday life.",

    "content": "So, I think if asked to, I can finally pronounce the name of the Weapon Series (Kukuhroziat) best-suited for running the newly introduced Geometric Labyrinth in PSO2 NGS (I did have to look up the spelling, however.) Fortunately, the PSO2 NGS First Anniversary Event, which started May 11, brings a new Elemental Weapon Series that is much easier to say (and spell) – the Obscura Weapon Series. Weapons from this series will drop in the new Limited-time Quest Drill: Dazzling Chaos Suppression Op and can be exchanged for Seasonal Points at the Seasonal Points Exchange Shop, which will be staffed by Xitre, as she has returned from her vacation. The Anniversary Event also includes changes to the décor of Retem and Central City, possible sightings of the Anni Rappy, and additional gathering materials in the form of Annivesartichoke and Randomite. What is most exciting for me, however, is the introduction of new Trials in all Sectors that feature a new enemy – Captan. This enemy reminds me of a rare enemy that I occasionally encountered in PSO2, Mesetan, which dropped oodles of Meseta.",
